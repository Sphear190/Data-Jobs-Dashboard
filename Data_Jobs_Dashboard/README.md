![First Page](/images/data_jobs_dashboard_image.png)

## Introduction

This dashboard was made to be used by people who are trying to get a data job (**Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, etc.**) and want more information about these jobs. The user can easily navigate the dashboard to find what these jobs offer, where these jobs can be found, and even when is the best time to apply. I made this dashboard while taking an online class created by [Luke Barousse](https://github.com/lukebarousse) and [Kelly Adams](https://github.com/kellyjadams) as part of a project. To make it clear this was a step-by-step project and not one made from scratch, however it does showcase skills I have learned and am capable of using.

## Skills Used

-   **Dashboard Design:** A simple and clean design is used to keep from overwhelming the user while still making it easy to use. Background shapes are used to focus the user's attention on the graphs and make the dashboard feel less like an overwhelming page. Mono-color format prevents the user from being distracted by multiple colors while darker shades focus the user's attention on kep information. 

-   **Pages With A Purpose:** The first page is made to compare hiring demand and salary among data jobs. This helps give the user an idea of which job to focus on. Then then can use the *drill through* to find more details about the selected job. The second page (once drilled through) showcases many details about the job that would otherwise clutter the page if compared with other jobs and should the user want to look at other jobs they can simply use the go back button. By giving each page a purpose, it prevents the user from being overwhelmed and keeps then on track.

-   **Chart Usage:** There are many charts that can be used to shows a variety of information; however, too much can just be a visual mess. While *Gauges & Cards* may seem simple, they are very effective for displaying key information without being overwhelming. For comparative data the charts ranged in complexity based on what was being asked. *Line & Bar Charts* are used for simple comparisons, while *Matrix & Map* are used to display more complex data.

## Dashboard Overview

### First Page: Salary & Hiring Trends

The First page uses basic comparisons of data jobs to give the user a simple ideal as to what each job may offer. By clicking on a data job, the user then gets more information about salary and hiring trends. They then can use the *Drill Through* button to get more detailed information on the second page. 

### Second Page: Drill Through Details

The second page displays more detailed data about the individual jobs giving the user a better idea of what the job may offer and even where to apply for the job. If they find the job not up to their needs, they can then click the go back button to return to the first page and look at a different job.

## Conclusion


This Dashboard uses a variety of charts that display vast range of data related to individual *Data Jobs*. Using Poer BI it is presented in a clean and easy to navigate format with the purpose of being user friendly. Anyone looking for a data job with this dashboard will be able to get a better idea of not only what these individual jobs offer but where and when to apply for one.
